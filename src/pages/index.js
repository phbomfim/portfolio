            I'm a Software Engineer, always open to new ideas !
            Freelancer, student and enthusiastic about change. From Salvador, Brazil, developing applications since 2014 and listening to music since 1996 üôÉ

            I started in this world when I was 14 years old, developing personal games servers and creating cheats for them.  
            I spent many hours watching tutorials, reading files, discovering features and testing various programs.
            There was not much documentation in Portuguese, so I had to learn English in a "forced" way.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I started in the Federal University of Bahia, I developed logical programs and participated in several programming competitions.
            The study of logic took me to another level, giving me more courage and more desire to continue studying.
            Shortly thereafter I entered the world of web programming, developing apps, websites, dashboards and a lot of programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017 I made my first contact with a company and I created a data controller for more than 200 user to use directly.
            I faced many difficulties, considering that every study was done individually, without the presence of a supervisor.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018 I made my first contact with a programming team, at OmniCode Solutions. 
            It was this place that I had contact with the main technologies used by the main programmers in the world, in addition to making contact with customers worldwide.
            Since then I don't stopped studying and building solutions for the most diverse clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019 I started participating in volunteer projects to teach programming to young people. I really love to teach.
            I also participated in programming events as an instructor, working mainly with Ruby on Rails.
            And 2019 I also created <strong><a href="https://phbomfim.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">my blog</a></strong>, where I try to pass on my knowledge to the world. Whenever possible I make posts about the most diverse contents.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I believe that education is the basis for human and living development focused on this! ‚úäüèæ </strong>
